Unfortunately, some of the code is actually missing and lost. The Maze.java file is an older version even though the MazeTest.java is the finished version. So the code in the repository will not compile into a completed project. Both files should have close to 1,000 lines of code. But the Maze.java file only has 370 lines.
However, the .jar file is still a playable game.
